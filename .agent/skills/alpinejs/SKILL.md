# Alpine.js Skill

Use Alpine.js for lightweight frontend interactivity in Laravel Blade templates.

## Principles
- **Declarative**: Use `x-data`, `x-init`, and `x-show` to manage state directly in HTML.
- **Minimalist**: Keep logic simple. If it gets complex, consider a dedicated component or a different tool.

## Common Directives
- `x-data`: Define a component's state.
- `x-on` (or `@`): Listen for browser events.
- `x-bind` (or `:`): Bind attributes to expressions.
- `x-model`: Two-way data binding.

## Integration with Laravel
- Ideal for modals, dropdowns, and simple toggleable UI elements.
