# Tailwind CSS Skill

## Philosophy
- **Utility-First**: Build complex components by composing simple utilities.
- **Consistency**: Use the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) for theme consistency.

## Layout Patterns
- **Flexbox**: Use `flex`, `items-center`, `justify-between` for row alignments.
- **Grid**: Use `grid`, `grid-cols-*`, `gap-*` for structured layouts.

## Responsive Design
- Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`, `xl:` prefixes to handle different screen sizes.
