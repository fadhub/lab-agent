# Lucide Icons Skill

Lucide is a beautiful, open-source icon library.

## Usage in Blade
- Use the `@lucide` directive if using a specific package, or simply SVG components.
- Standardize icon sizes: `w-5 h-5` for buttons, `w-6 h-6` for headers.

## Consistency
- Avoid mixing Lucide with other icon libraries unless necessary.
